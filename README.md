# Shark #

A framework for controlling, recording, training, and running a self driving robotic car. Focused now on an implementation that runs on 1/10th scale rc cars with pwm servo steering and ESC throttle controller driven by an Adafruit Servo hat on a RaspberryPi 3.

### Goals ###

* Use ZeroMQ and C/Python to create a mesh of components that are flexible and fast 
* Run all code on the robot ( pi 3 )
* Manage things with a mobile device via web page and joystick controller

### Build your bot ###
* check docs/bot_setup.md

### How do I get set up? ###

On your Pi:

* clone the repo
* Check dependencies.txt, build and install dependent libraries.
* add /usr/local/lib to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH env
* copy config_example.json to config.json and modify to match your bot setup
* mkdir build && cd build
* cmake .. && make
* cd ..
* plug a joystick controller into your pi
* python shark.py
* optionally run the webserver. cd web && python webapp.py

Once you are ready, you can install them as services. 
Check shark.service and sharkweb.service to run on startup.

## Workflow ##

### Check camera output: ###
* Navigate to [web page](http://pi.local:8080)
* Select 'robot'. You should see a live image from camera

### Logging: ###
* press X on PS3 Sixaxis controls to enable recording
* left analog to steer, right analog forward to throttle
* only recording when throttle is non zero
* press X to disable recording

### Edit logs: ###
* Navigate to [web page](http://pi.local:8080)
* Select 'log'
* Select 'view/edit logs'
* observe recorded logs
* if unwanted frames, use slider, 'set trim start', and 'set trim end' to set range
* use 'trim log' button to remove unwanted frames

### Manual Training: ###
* copy logs to your PC: scp me@pi.local:~/projects/shark/log/*.jpg ~/projects/shark/log
* train model on your PC: python train.py mymodel
* cp mymodel to pi: scp mymodel me@pi.local:~/projects/shark/model/
* on the pi: python shark.py --model mymodel

### Web EC2 Based Training: ###
* check docs/aws_setup.md
* Navigate to [web page](http://pi.local:8080)
* Select 'ec2' button
* Select 'start ec2'
* Wait for 1 to 2 minutes and select 'check ec2' until the machine is ready.
* Select 'prepare host' to copy code to remote host
* From the home menu select 'log'
* Select 'upload logs'
* From the home menu select 'train'
* Select 'model' and name the new model
* Optionally select 'epochs' and set upper limit of epochs
* Select 'train' to start training. Feedback varies depending on browser. Better luck from a desktop browser. Tested mostly on Firefox.
* When complete, select 'push model' to tell robot predict loop to load that trained result.
* Ready to test self driving
* When you are done with server, select 'release ec2' to shutdown remote machine.

### Self Driving: ###
* hit triangle toggle start self steering.
* use dpad up and down to increase throttle scale
